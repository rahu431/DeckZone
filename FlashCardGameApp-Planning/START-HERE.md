## 🛠️ Implementation Roadmap (45 Steps)

### **Phase 1: Base Setup** - Foundation
```bash
# Step 1: Create project
npx create-expo-app DeckZone --template blank-typescript
cd DeckZone

# Step 2: Install dependencies (see technical/architecture.md)
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install zustand react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
# ... (full dependency list in architecture.md)
```

   1. Install ESLint and necessary plugins: I'll install eslint, @react-native-community/eslint-config, @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, and
      @typescript-eslint/parser.
   2. Create a `.eslintrc.js` configuration file: This file will define the linting rules, extending from the recommended React Native and
      TypeScript configurations.
   3. Add lint scripts to `package.json`: I'll add lint and lint:fix scripts for easy execution.

**Focus Documents**: `technical/architecture.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
**Deliverable**: Working Expo app with TypeScript and basic structure

### **Phase 2: Design System** - Visual Foundation
**Focus Documents**: `technical/design-system.md`, `technical/component-library.md`
**Deliverable**: Complete design system with atoms, molecules, theme provider

### **Phase 3: Navigation** - App Structure
**Focus Documents**: `technical/navigation-system.md`, `screens/`
**Deliverable**: TikTok-style navigation with gesture handling

### **Phase 4: Authentication** - User System
**Focus Documents**: `authentication/social-login-spec.md`, `screens/01-welcome-screen.md`
**Deliverable**: Complete social login with Firebase integration

### **Phase 5: Game Interface** - Core Gameplay
**Focus Documents**: `screens/03-game-screen.md`, `technical/state-management.md`
**Deliverable**: Full-screen card interface with swipe navigation

### **Phase 6: First Game** - MVP Game
**Focus Documents**: `games/picture-charades.md`
**Deliverable**: Complete Picture Charades game with all features

### **Phase 7: All Games** - Full Game Suite
**Focus Documents**: All `games/*.md` files
**Deliverable**: All 5 games fully implemented and tested

### **Phase 8: User Features** - User Experience
**Focus Documents**: `screens/02-home-screen.md`, `screens/04-profile-screen.md`, `screens/05-settings-screen.md`
**Deliverable**: Complete user experience with profiles and settings

### **Phase 9: Polish** - Production Ready
**Focus Documents**: `technical/performance-optimization.md`, `technical/accessibility-implementation.md`
**Deliverable**: App store ready application

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### **Performance Targets**
- App startup: <3 seconds
- Navigation: <300ms transitions
- Animations: Consistent 60fps
- Memory usage: <150MB peak
- Bundle size: <50MB

### **Accessibility Requirements**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader support (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 minimum
- Touch targets: 44px minimum

### **Quality Gates**
Each phase must pass:
- [ ] All TypeScript types resolved
- [ ] Performance metrics met
- [ ] Accessibility tests passed
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 🚨 Important Development Rules

### **Architecture Principles**
1. **Offline-First**: Every feature must work without internet
2. **Accessibility-First**: WCAG compliance built into every component
3. **Performance-First**: 60fps animations, optimized memory usage
4. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript coverage, no `any` types
5. **Atomic Design**: Build components atoms → molecules → organisms

### **Code Standards**
- Follow patterns in `technical/component-library.md`
- Use state management per `technical/state-management.md`
- Implement accessibility per `technical/accessibility-implementation.md`
- Optimize performance per `technical/performance-optimization.md`

### **Testing Requirements**
- Unit tests for all utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user flows
- Accessibility tests for screen readers
- Performance tests for 60fps compliance

## 🎮 Game Implementation Priority

**Start with Picture Charades** as MVP:
1. Simplest game mechanics
2. Visual content (images)
3. Clear success criteria
4. Foundation for other games

**Then implement in this order**:
1. Picture Charades (visual acting)
2. Would You Rather (text-based decisions)
3. Animal Kingdom (educational + visual)
4. Ice Breakers (social interaction)
5. Movie Mania (complex trivia)

## 📱 Platform Considerations

### **iOS Specific**
- Safe area handling for notches
- Haptic feedback implementation
- Apple Sign-In integration
- VoiceOver accessibility

### **Android Specific**
- Edge-to-edge display handling
- TalkBack accessibility
- Android-specific animations
- Hardware back button handling

## 🔧 Development Tools Setup

### **Required Tools**
- **VS Code** with React Native extensions
- **Expo Dev Tools** for debugging
- **React Developer Tools** for component inspection
- **Flipper** for React Native debugging (optional)

### **Recommended Extensions**
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- TypeScript Importer
- Auto Rename Tag
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
